# GraphQL-Books-Project

This repository contains the set up of graphql server and client using apollo-server and apollo-client respectively.
We can connect a client-side application with a graphql server.
Here , I have used React with typescript app to integrate the graphql server with Apollo Client.

Steps :
1. First run the apollo server using following cmd in Apollo-Server/
   
   npm run dev
  
3. Run the react app using the following cmd in Apollo-Client/
   
   npm start
